\section{Introduction}

We investigate the implementation and benchmarking of the Steepest Descent and Newton's Method, both using backtracking line search. We aim to analyze their convergence behavior and compare their efficiency.  We also solve theoretical problems that provide insights into the algorithmic choices and expected performance.

\section{Theory}

\subsection{Stopping Criteria}
% Explanation of stopping criteria and justification for their choice
Stopping criteria such as gradient norm, function value difference, and step size are discussed. Threshold values and their impact on convergence are analyzed.

\subsection{Backtracking Line Search Parameter Selection}
% Discussion on parameter choices for line search
Parameters such as initial step size, shrinkage factor, and Armijo condition constant are considered. Sensitivity analysis of these choices is performed.

\subsection{Convergence Analysis}
% Theoretical background on Q-linear, Q-superlinear, and Q-quadratic convergence
We analyze convergence rates of both algorithms and establish theoretical expectations for different types of functions.

\subsection{Theoretical Problem 1: Sum of Different Powers Function}
% Derivation of Newton step and convergence properties
Explicit computation of the Newton step direction at a given point and proof that Newtonâ€™s Method exhibits Q-linear but not Q-superlinear convergence.

\subsection{Theoretical Problem 2: Sufficient Decrease Condition in 1D}
% Proof for sufficient decrease condition in polynomial functions
We prove the sufficient decrease condition for functions of the form $f(x) = ax^m$, demonstrating dependence on parameter $m$ and visualizing the condition.
